# Open source fpga toolchains, projects, and libraries
- [VexRiscV](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv): _RISC-V implementation written in SpinalHDL_
- [YosysHQ/yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys): _framework for RTL synthesis tools_
- [YosysHQ/nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr): _portable FPGA place and route tool_
- [nmigen](https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen): _Python toolbox for building complex digital hardware_
- [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex): _a Migen/MiSoC based Core/SoC builder that provides the infrastructure to create Cores/SoCs (with or without CPU)._
> Think of Migen as a toolbox to create FPGA designs in Python and LiteX as a SoC builder to create/develop/debug FPGA SoCs in Python.
- [Project X-Ray](https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjxray): _tools and scripts which allow you to document the bit-stream format of Xilinx 7-series FPGAs open_
- [Linux on LiteX](https://github.com/litex-hub/linux-on-litex-vexriscv): _In this repository, we experiment running Linux with VexRiscv CPU, a 32-bits Linux Capable RISC-V CPU written in Spinal HDL. A SoC around the VexRiscv CPU is created using LiteX as the SoC builder and LiteX's cores written in Migen Python DSL (LiteDRAM, LiteEth, LiteSDCard)._
- [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator): _Verilog/SystemVerilog simulator._
